## A first course / refresher course in python

Our recommendation is to work through this set of [python programming lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) from [Software Carpentries](http://software-carpentry.org/).  It's a great introduction to python specifically designed for people working with data in research domains.  It will quickly get you using python for analyzing data.

During NMA we're going to be relying [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to do our python programming, so we'd like you to try to use that when you do these python tutorials.  You can watch a short introduction to Google Colab [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXuGHN-8FlE&feature=youtu.be).  

One of our Neuromatch Academy TAs put together a [short video](https://colab.research.google.com/) to get you started with all of this.  She'll walk you through opening up Google Colab, show you how to get data files imported into Colab, and get you started on the first set of exercises.  If you don't have access to Google Colab you can follow the directions [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html) for getting setup with python on your local machine.

Once you're done with that, we highly recommend checking out sections 6-9 of this [other software carpentries python course]([http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).  It will introduce you to important python libraries for data analysis and plotting. *Remember to import the data files you need into Google Colab like we did with the first software carpentries course.*
