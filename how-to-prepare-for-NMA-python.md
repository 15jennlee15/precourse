## A first course / refresher course in python

Our recommendation for getting started with python or refreshing your python skills is to work through this set of [python programming lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) from [Software Carpentries](http://software-carpentry.org/).  It's a great introduction to python specifically designed for people working with data in research domains.  Its goal is to get you using python quickly for analyzing data.

During NMA we're going to be relying [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to do our python programming.  You can watch a short introduction to Google Colab [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXuGHN-8FlE&feature=youtu.be).  

One of our Neuromatch Academy TAs put together a [short video](video link here) to get you started with all of this.  She'll walk you through opening up Google Colab, show you how to get data files imported into Colab, and get you started on the first set of exercises.  If you don't have access to Google Colab you can follow the directions [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html) for getting setup with python on your local machine.


Once you're done with that, we highly recommend checking out sections 6-9 of this [other software carpentries python course]([http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).  It will introduce you to important python libraries for data analysis and plotting.
